    Path to images folder relative to the /node/server directory.
    I suggest using the zip found at http://pkmn.net/?action=content&page=viewpage&id=8644, extracting the
    Pokémon folder, and then choosing BW since the directory structure is what the script expects it to be.

    The server will search the following paths for images:
        pokemonImagesPath/
        pokemonImagesPath/female
        pokemonImagesPath/shiny
        pokemonImagesPath/shiny/female
        pokemonImagesPath/forms/...
    
    NOTE: Giratina's and Arceus' alternate forms aren't available by default.  If you want to use them:
        Run setupPokemonImages.cmd 
        
        OR:
        For Giratina, open /BW/forms/giratina directory, and rename the two "another" files (the one in the root and the
            one in Shiny) to "altered".
        For Arceus, find the various images you want to use (/DPPt/Arceus has them, and if you use them, you should use 
            the <type>2.pngs as they have transparent backgrounds), copy them into /BW/forms/arceus, and rename them all
            to be of the form "493<kind>.png" for non-shiny and "493s<kind>.png" for shiny.  *IMPORTANT*: <kind> is 
            from the list at https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_data_structure_in_Generation_IV#Alternate_forms,
            not the <type> already in the filename.  (Leave "mystery" as-is, since Windows doesn't support filenames 
            with question marks in them.)
